 Linux command Notes

I have learnt some file creating and editing commands in Linux 

Touch – this command creates and empty file.
	Example of this, touch testfile.txt

Echo- this command allows users to print text or variables in a file.
	Example of this, Echo “Hello world” >> testfile.txt

Cat- this command lets users see the contents of the file 
	Example of this, cat testfile.txt 
				Output “Hello world”

Grep- the command lets users search for specific texts inside files.
	Example of this, grep “Hello” testfile.txt
				Output “Hello world” (Hello is highlighted)
